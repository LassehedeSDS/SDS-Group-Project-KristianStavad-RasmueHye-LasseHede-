Muchroom classification

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Mushroom Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended to consume. 

We chose to work with this mushroom dataset as we find it an interesting area to investigate further by applying data science and machine learning techniques. We all, from time to time, consume mushrooms, even though that we possess a limited knowledge about which ones is edible and which ones are not. Therefore we found it an interesting task to investigate on a broader scale, which mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous, and if it would be possible to determined this by looking at the different variables such as color, shape, family etc.
